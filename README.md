Code and data for "Bank Risk Models: The Effects of the Financial Crisis".
In May 2021, added data through 2020 Dec, updated for 2021 CCAR stress tests, updated Jupyter notebook files.  PLEASE NOTE: Due to huge distortions caused by the COVID pandemic on unemployment, GDP, mortgage delinquencies, etc, I have decided that this update will be the last.
